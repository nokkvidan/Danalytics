# Danalytics

My name is Nökkvi Dan Elliðason and I work remotely as a freelance data analyst/scientist. 
I hold a Bachelor’s degree in Applied Mathematics, Statistics, and Data Analytics from the University of Iceland and a 
Master’s degree in Statistics and Data Science from Yale University.

Since I was young, I have always enjoyed solving puzzles. So that’s how I look at big data sets: 
to me, it is one big puzzle I want to solve. Finding patterns nobody else sees is a challenge to me. 
Mathematics has given me a backstage pass to understanding the world around me and has helped my development as a workforce.
